    <h3>Joyce Peacock - Endless possibilities at the Library</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Joyce, and I have worked in libraries pretty much my whole adult life (which is a crazily long time). I am using a Dell Precision PC for my work in this class.   </p>

      I was cruising along with the part 1 of the assignment at first. Then I hit a snafu. None of my changes in Atom were reflected in the local file. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that I forgot to save my changes. So, I went about uninstalling and reinstalling everything. In doing so, it caused grunt to no longer work in Atom. But when I Googled (that's a verb, right?) the not found in error codes, I found a fix for changing the Pathways. This fixed my problem. It took me a long time to set up all the hosting and github stuff too. All this coding in the terminal scares me. I am a visual and kinesthetic learner, and It was a lot of re-watching the video. But it got done! Now I hope everything is set up. Phew!</p>
